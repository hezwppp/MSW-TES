# MSW-TES
An SW-TES hybrid algorithm for retrieving mountainous land surface temperature from high-resolution thermal infrared remote sensing data

This project includes:
(1) The bright temperature data of five ASTER TIR bands simulated by the proposed three-dimensional thermal infrared radiation transfer model;
(2) Three-dimensional lookup table of Improved SW (ISW) coefficients;
(3) Two-dimensional lookup table of SW coefficients;
(4) All the code of the MSW-TES algorithm;

Notice: Users only need to input five ASTER TIR band data, atmospheric parameters and terrain factors into the code to invert MLST.
